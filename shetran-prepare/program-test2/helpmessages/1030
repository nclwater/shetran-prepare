	In adjusting the surface water flow rate at the given element
	face (either to preserve the sign of the surface elevation
	gradient or to disallow unphysically small flow rates),some
	water has been introduced artificially, as an "external source"
	(because it was not possible to make the corresponding
	adjustment in the neighbouring element).  The precise amount
	added is given as a depth (m).
	NB: This adjustment will contribute to the global mass balance
            error for the catchment.
