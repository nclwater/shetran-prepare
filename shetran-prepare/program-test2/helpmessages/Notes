			SHETRAN Error Codes
			___________________


    (i)	Error code numbers take the form 1000*m+n, where 0<=m<=3 and
	0<=n<=100.  In general m is the module identifier:

		0  Library (AL);
		1  Water (WAT) or Frame (FR);
		2  Sediment (SY);
		3  Contaminant (CM).

	Error code 0000 however is a special case associated with
	module FR.  The error code number is the second argument to
	subroutine ERROR.

   (ii)	Error types N, F, E and W correspond to the numeric value of
	the first argument to subroutine ERROR as follows:

		0  None: no error: just print a message and, if the
		   error code number is zero, a summary of all errors
		   to date;

		1  Fatal: program execution cannot continue;

		2  Error: an inadmissible condition has been detected,
		   but immediate termination is not required;

		3  Warning: an undesirable condition has been detected:
		   may be used to inform the user of corrective action
		   taken by the program.
