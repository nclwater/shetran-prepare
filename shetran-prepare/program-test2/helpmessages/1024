	In adjusting the surface water depth of the given element (eg to
	make it non-negative), some water has been introduced
	artificially, as an "external source" (because it was not
	possible to make corresponding adjustments in neighbouring
	elements).  The precise amount added is the sum of two values,
	each given as a depth (m): the first is introduced at the inter-
	element boundaries (manifest in the flow rates); and the second
	is introduced at the element itself (manifest in the water
	depth).
	NB: These adjustments will contribute to the global mass balance
	    error for the catchment.
