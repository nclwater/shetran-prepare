0015  W  INRES  980129
	An element has been assigned more than once to the same data class
	in the PPD file (entries :PP3, :PP7, :PP9, :PP13, :PP15 and :PP17).
	=> Duplication may be avoided by giving "0" (null assignment) for
	   any element for which no assignment is required in a distribution
	   grid.
