	Attempts to renumber cells have failed.
If error 1037 occurs due to the thickness of a layer being too different to
the thickness of an adjacent connected layer, additional cells are inserted 
into the layer with the smaller thickness.  This may change the cell 
connectivity for the other faces of the element, so the code setting up cell 
connectivities for all elements is rerun.  To avoid the possibility of 
entering an infinite loop, a limit is set to the number of times this can
occur.  This limit has been exceeded.  CHECK THE LAYER DEFINITION INPUT DATA
AND USER-DEFINED LAYER CONNECTIVITIES.
