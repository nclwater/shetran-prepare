1028  F  OCNODE  980212
	The iterative procedure employed to calculate flow rates at a
	branched node has failed, after 50 iterations, to meet the
	minimal convergence criterion, viz: mass balance error not more
	than 10% of total branch flows; and change of (notional) nodal
	elevation not more than 50mm between iterations.
	=> Attempt to reduce the error eg: by using finer temporal
	   and/or spatial resolution; or by altering the convergence
	   criteria in the source code for subroutine OCNODE.
