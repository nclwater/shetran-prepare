	Maximum iterations in VSS global solver

The VSS solvers may occasionally not converge within the alloted number
of iterations for extreme boundary conditions or source/sink terms (eg. if
unusually high values are given for well abstraction).  Normally, however,
the solution will have nearly converged, and the simulation can proceed. 
CHECK THE METEOROLOGICAL, BOUNDARY CONDITION, AND SOURCE/SINK TERM DATA TO
ENSURE THAT EXTREME VALUES HAVE NOT BEEN ENTERED ERRONEOUSLY.
