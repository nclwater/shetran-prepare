	Not possible to connect all cells for face N layer M.

During the automatic setting up of the cell connectivities, two adjacent
connected layers (or sequences of layers) have been found where the number
of cells in one layer (or sequence of layers) is more than twice the number  
in the adjacent layer (or sequence of layers).  Since each cell can be connected
to at most two adjacent cells, this is not allowed.  It is corrected 
automatically by increasing the number of cells in the layer(s) with the
lesser number to at least half of the number of cells in the adjacent 
layer(s).  This can be avoided, if required, by ensuring that the difference
in thickness of any layer between any two adjacent columns is not too great.
