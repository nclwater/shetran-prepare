1027  W  OCNODE  980212
	The iterative procedure employed to calculate flow rates at a
	branched node has failed to meet the primary convergence
	criterion, viz: mass balance error not more than 1% of total
	branch flows; and change of (notional) nodal elevation not more
	than 1mm between iterations.
	The following secondary criterion was, however, satisfied:
	as above, but with values of 10% and 50mm respectively.
	=> If this level of convergence is not acceptable, attempt to
	   reduce the error eg: by using finer temporal and/or spatial
	   resolution; or by altering the convergence criteria in the
	   source code for subroutine OCNODE.
