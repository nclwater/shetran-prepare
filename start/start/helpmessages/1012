	The cross-section index IDEFX for a channel link must be either:
	between -NDEFCT and -1, where NDEFCT is the number of default
	cross-section categories (entry :OC30 in the OCD file); or
	between 2 and NOCTAB, where NOCTAB is the array-size parameter
	defined in the include-file AL.P.
	=> Check entries :OC35 in the OCD file.
	=> Increase the value of NOCTAB if necessary.
