1060  F  OCFIX  980729
	Subroutine OCFIX attempts to adjust the surface water depths and
	flow rates returned by the linear solver, in order to impose
	certain criteria (eg non-negative depth) required elsewhere in
	the program.  The procedure involves repeated passes over the
	whole catchment, with adjustments made as necessary, and is
	complete when a pass is clean, ie when all criteria are met
	without further adjustments.  To avoid excessive computation the
	number of passes allowed is limited to NPASS (an integer
	constant defined in OCFIX).  This number of passes has now been
	reached, and the last pass was still not clean.
	=> [crude] Increase the value of NPASS in subroutine OCFIX; or
	=> [sophisticated] alter the floating-point values HCRIT, UHCRIT
	   and DZMIN (constants defined in OCFIX) used in the evaluation
	   of the criteria.
