	This version does not support the option to assign bank element
	data by reading pairs of (data_class,value) from the BKD file.
	NB: The implementation in earlier versions was incorrect:
	    bank elements were selected from the list 1,2,...,n (where
	    n is the number of elements in the class) instead of from
	    the list itself ICLIST(i,class), i=1,2,...,n.
