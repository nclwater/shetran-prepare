1045  F  VSPREP (line 127)  
	End of column base flow boundary condition file (BFB)

The end time in a time-series boundary condition file has been exceeded.
(Note that the last line in time-series files should exceed the end time
of the simulation, as the final timestep of a simulation may go beyond
the requested end time by one or two hours.)  EITHER ADD AN EXTRA LINE TO
THE TIME-SERIES FILE, OR REDUCE THE LENGTH OF THE SIMULATION.
