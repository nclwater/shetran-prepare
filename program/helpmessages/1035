	The value of matric potential has exceeded the extreme dry value in the
	internal tables of soil property functions.  THIS SHOULD NOT
	NORMALLY HAPPEN.  There may be a number of causes.  A possible cause
	may be that unusual values have been input to describe the soil
	property functions
	=> Check the soil property functions.
	=> Check if any other errors have occurred during the simulation.
